Activity 3 – Technology Comparison Matrix
1. Introduction
The previous activities evaluated different frontend, backend, database, and authentication technologies for the FitFlow redesign.

This activity consolidates the evaluation into weighted decision matrices. Each technology is scored from 1 to 5, where:

1 = Poor
2 = Fair
3 = Good
4 = Very Good
5 = Excellent
Higher weights are given to criteria that are more important for FitFlow.

2. Frontend Technology Decision Matrix
Criteria	Weight	Flutter	React Native	Kotlin Multiplatform	Swift/SwiftUI
Performance	20%	5	4	5	5
Cross-Platform Support	20%	5	5	4	2
Development Speed	15%	5	4	3	4
Code Reusability	15%	5	5	4	2
Web Compatibility	10%	5	4	3	1
Ecosystem Support	10%	5	5	4	5
Maintenance	10%	5	4	3	3
Weighted Score	100%	4.8/5	4.5/5	3.8/5	2.8/5
Recommendation
Flutter receives the highest weighted score of 4.8/5.

Flutter is recommended because FitFlow requires Android, iOS, and web support while maintaining a consistent UI and reducing development and maintenance effort.

3. Backend Technology Decision Matrix
Criteria	Weight	Node.js/NestJS	Python/FastAPI	Go
Performance	20%	4	4	5
Development Speed	15%	5	5	3
Scalability	15%	5	4	5
Real-Time Support	15%	5	4	5
AI/ML Integration	15%	4	5	3
Ecosystem	10%	5	5	4
Maintainability	10%	5	4	4
Weighted Score	100%	4.45/5	4.35/5	4.25/5
Recommendation
Node.js/NestJS receives the highest weighted score of 4.45/5.

NestJS is recommended as the main backend because of its strong real-time support, scalability, TypeScript ecosystem, development speed, and maintainability.

Python/FastAPI can be used separately for AI/ML functionality.

4. Database Decision Matrix
Criteria	Weight	PostgreSQL	MongoDB	Firebase	DynamoDB
Query Performance	15%	5	4	3	5
Scalability	15%	5	5	5	5
Health Data Handling	20%	5	4	3	4
Complex Queries	15%	5	3	2	3
Real-Time Support	10%	4	4	5	4
Security	10%	5	4	4	5
Cost	5%	4	4	4	3
Maintainability	10%	5	4	4	3
Weighted Score	100%	4.65/5	3.9/5	3.65/5	3.75/5
Recommendation
PostgreSQL receives the highest weighted score of 4.65/5.

PostgreSQL is recommended because FitFlow requires structured health, workout, nutrition, user, and progress data together with complex queries and strong data consistency.

Firebase can still be used for selected real-time services.

5. Authentication Decision Matrix
Criteria	Weight	Firebase Auth	AWS Cognito	Auth0	Supabase Auth
Security	25%	5	5	5	5
Development Ease	20%	5	4	5	5
Scalability	15%	5	5	5	5
Cost	15%	4	4	3	4
Authorization	10%	4	5	5	4
Maintenance	10%	5	4	5	5
Integration	5%	5	5	4	5
Weighted Score	100%	4.55/5	4.25/5	4.55/5	4.4/5
Recommendation
Although Firebase Auth and Auth0 achieve slightly higher scores, Supabase Auth is recommended for FitFlow because it integrates closely with PostgreSQL and provides a good balance of security, simplicity, and maintainability.

6. Overall Recommended Technology Stack
Based on the decision matrices, the recommended technology stack is:

System Layer	Selected Technology	Main Reason
Frontend	Flutter	Cross-platform development and performance
Backend	Node.js / NestJS	Scalability, real-time support and maintainability
Database	PostgreSQL	Structured health data and complex queries
Authentication	Supabase Auth	Security and PostgreSQL integration
AI/ML	Python / FastAPI	Strong AI/ML ecosystem
Caching	Redis	Fast data access and scalability
Real-Time	WebSockets / Firebase	Real-time updates and notifications
7. Final Decision
The weighted comparison shows that the following combination is the most suitable for the FitFlow redesign:

Flutter + Node.js/NestJS + PostgreSQL + Supabase Auth + Python/FastAPI + Redis + WebSockets/Firebase

This combination provides:

High application performance.
Android, iOS, and web support.
High code reusability.
Scalable backend architecture.
Strong relational data management.
Secure authentication.
AI/ML integration.
Real-time functionality.
Lower long-term maintenance effort.
The architecture also allows individual services to be scaled or replaced independently as FitFlow grows.
